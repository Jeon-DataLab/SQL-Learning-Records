Database: Medium to store data.
Relational Database: Define relationships between tables of data inside the database.
Advantages: compared to spreadsheet, 1. Can store more data. 2. More secure 3. Many users can write queries to gather insights from data at the same time.

SQL: Structured Query Language - Programming language for creating, querying and updating relational databases.

Tables: Database is organized into tables, which hold related data about a particular subject. Rows: records, Columns: fields.
*Fields are limited to those set when the database was created, but the number of rows is unlimited.

Table parts: 
- Records: a row that holds data on an individual observation

- Fields: Holds one piece of information about all records.

- Keys: Unique Identifiers - unique value which identifies a record -- often a number.

SQL Data Types:
- Number, text, date

Use of data types: 
1. Different types data stored differently and take up different amounts of storage space.
2. Some operations only apply to certain data types.

Strings: a sequence of characters such as letters or punctuation
  - Some string data types can only hold short strings, such as a string up to 250 characters.
  - VARCHAR: Flexible and popular string data type in SQL.

Integers: store whole numbers
  - INT: flexible and popular data type.

Floats: Fractional part ex:) 9.86, 0, 2.05
  - NUMERIC is a flexible and popular float data type

Schemas(Blueprints of a database): Shows a database's design, such as what tables are.
  - Reader know what data type each field can hold.

Database Storage: Stored on the hard disk of a server. 
  - Servers are centralized computers that perform services via requests made over a network.
  - They can be a computer or any centralized system.
